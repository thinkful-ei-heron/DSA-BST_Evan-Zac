# Evan and Zac's DSA-BST assignment

## 1) Draw a BST
```
       3
1   		4
	2   		6
		  	5		9
			  	  7

		E
A			S
	E	  Q		Y
		I  S   U
		 O    T
		N
```

## 2) Remove the Root
```
   		4
1	   		  6
	2	  	5		9
			  	  7

		I
A			S
	E	  Q		Y
		O  S   U
	   N      T
```

## 4) What does this program do?
- It looks like this program recursively adds every value in the tree.
- The runtime is linear
